## Game Rules

This game consists of a player character and enemy bugs. The goal of the game is to reach the water, without colliding into any of the enemies, and the player can move left, right, up and down with the keyboard arrow keys. Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

**This is a simple game test.**
